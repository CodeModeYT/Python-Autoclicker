# Python-Autoclicker
First version, new advanced versions also using other libraries coming soon.

#### **Required library**
To simulate the mouse-click, we use pynput, a library working on macOS, Windows and Linux

#### **Credits**
I got the idea by an article of geeksforgeeks.org

#### **Code Explanation**
A Video of me coding this project and explaining it can be found on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/yOfWIeJ1lIY)
